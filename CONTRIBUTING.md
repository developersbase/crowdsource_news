# Contribution Guidelines for Crowdsource News

This file denotes **Code Formatting** guidelines and basic instructions on writing **Commit Messages.**

A standard and consistent formatting is necessary for **Good Readability** and aesthetics. Open-source projects should be as consistent and as well documented as possible in order for them to be easy to work on top of by others who want to build on or contribute to the projects.

#### The following will provide instructions on code formatting to be used by *all contributors* contributing to *any project* of this organization.

Formatting The Code
--

- Use **Auto Format** command before each and every push/pr.
- Use **4 Spaces** as indentation. [ Mentioned specifically if otherwise needed ]
- **Avoid long lines** as much as possible. Shorter and stacked code is much easier to read and understand.
- **Do not** forget to add proper comments where necessary.
- Use **Comment Dividers** to separate code sections.
- Cluster **Similar types of Variables, Function Calls, Initiators**.
- Divide code into **Sections.**  

Naming Variables
--

- Make sure variable names make sense. Put some time into planning structures and variable names before jumping into coding.
- Use **lowerCamelCase** naming convention for variables.
- Use **UpperCamelCase** naming convention for Class Names.
- Avoid `_` in variable or class names.
- **Do Not** use ambiguous variable naming. Think well about your nested **Objects & Array** before you type them out.
